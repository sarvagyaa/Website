# The Data Beetle Website

This is the code for my website, [Data Beetle](https://databeetle.pythonanywhere.com/), an introduction to my work. I've used [CodeRed CMS](https://www.coderedcorp.com/cms/) to create it and [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to host it.

## Getting started with CodeRed CMS

Make sure Python 3.4 or higher is installed on your system.
Open this directory in a command prompt, then:

1. Install the software: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`
3. Go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser, or http://localhost:8000/admin/ to log in and get to work!
